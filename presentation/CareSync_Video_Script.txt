------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:30) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Speaker on camera OR title card with team name + CareSync logo

SCRIPT:
"Hello everyone! I'm [Your Name], and I'm here representing Team KludgeKings.

Today, I'm excited to present CareSync — our AI-powered smart patient triage 
system built entirely with .NET MAUI for the Android platform.

CareSync tackles one of healthcare's most pressing challenges: making emergency 
department triage faster, fairer, and more consistent using machine learning.

Let me show you what we've built."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING (0:30 - 1:00) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Statistics overlay OR simple graphics showing ED overcrowding

SCRIPT:
"Every year, over 145 million people visit emergency departments in the US alone. 
The average wait time? Over 4 hours.

The problem isn't just long waits — it's inconsistent triage decisions. 
Studies show up to 30% variation in how patients are prioritized depending 
on which staff member assesses them and when.

This inconsistency can lead to delayed treatment for critical patients and 
misallocation of hospital resources.

CareSync solves this with AI-powered, consistent, and explainable triage."

[TRANSITION: Cut to app demo]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 3: APP OVERVIEW & DESIGN (1:00 - 1:45) [45 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording - Navigate through app home screen and login

SCRIPT:
"CareSync is built with .NET 10 MAUI Blazor Hybrid — allowing us to create 
a native Android app with a single C# codebase that also runs on Windows, 
iOS, and macOS.

[Show Home Screen]
Our design follows a clean, healthcare-focused aesthetic with our signature 
teal color scheme. The interface is intuitive — patients, doctors, and 
administrators each have their own tailored portal.

[Show Login Screen]
We implemented secure authentication with BCrypt password hashing. 
The app supports three user roles: Patients who can register and track 
their status, Doctors who manage their assigned patients, and Administrators 
who oversee the entire system.

[Navigate to Patient Portal]
Let me walk you through the core features."

[TRANSITION: Smooth scroll to Patient Intake]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 4: PATIENT INTAKE FEATURE (1:45 - 2:15) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording - Patient registration and intake form

SCRIPT:
"Starting with Patient Intake — this is where patients enter or staff record 
the critical information.

[Fill out form on screen]
We capture demographics, vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, 
temperature, and oxygen saturation. Patients can describe their symptoms 
and list any pre-existing conditions like diabetes or heart disease.

[Show form validation]
The form has real-time validation to ensure data quality. Once submitted, 
the magic happens — our AI takes over."

[TRANSITION: Navigate to Triage Assessment]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 5: AI TRIAGE ASSESSMENT (2:15 - 3:00) [45 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording - Triage assessment page showing AI prediction

SCRIPT:
"This is the heart of CareSync — our AI Triage Assessment.

[Show prediction results]
When we run the assessment, our ML.NET model analyzes 12 different features 
from the patient data. It uses an SDCA Maximum Entropy algorithm — a 
multi-class classifier that predicts risk levels: Emergency, Urgent, 
Standard, or Non-Urgent.

[Highlight the risk badge and confidence score]
See this? The AI doesn't just give a label — it provides a confidence 
percentage and most importantly, a human-readable explanation of WHY 
it made that decision, citing actual patient values.

[Show department recommendation]
It also recommends the appropriate department — Cardiology, Pulmonology, 
Neurology, Emergency, or General Medicine — based on symptom patterns 
and vital sign analysis.

[Show Rule-based vs ML indicator]
We built a dual system: if the ML model isn't trained yet, clinical rules 
kick in as a fallback. The app ALWAYS works."

[TRANSITION: Navigate to AI Model Management]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 6: MODEL TRAINING & MANAGEMENT (3:00 - 3:30) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording - AI Model Management page

SCRIPT:
"For administrators, we have the AI Model Management page.

[Show CSV upload interface]
Hospitals can train the model on their own patient data by uploading a 
CSV file. The system automatically detects the format, transforms the 
data, and trains with an 80/20 train-test split.

[Show model metrics if visible]
After training, we display accuracy metrics and the model version is 
tracked with timestamps — important for regulatory compliance.

[Show Bias Analysis section]
And here's something we're particularly proud of — built-in Bias Analysis. 
The system automatically checks for demographic fairness across gender 
and age groups, calculating a Fairness Score. This ensures our AI 
doesn't discriminate."

[TRANSITION: Navigate to Admin Dashboard]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 7: ADMIN & DOCTOR FEATURES (3:30 - 4:00) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Screen recording - Admin Dashboard and Doctor Management

SCRIPT:
"The Admin Dashboard gives a bird's-eye view of the entire system — 
patient statistics, department load, and recent assessments.

[Navigate to Doctor Management]
Administrators can register doctors, set their specializations, and 
manage availability. The system uses this for intelligent patient-to-doctor 
assignment based on workload balancing.

[Show doctor list]
Doctors see their assigned patients, can access full medical histories, 
review AI assessments, and generate PDF reports.

[Show PDF generation if time]
Speaking of reports — we integrated iTextSharp for professional PDF 
export of patient records."

[TRANSITION: Quick montage of different screens]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 8: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (4:00 - 4:30) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Architecture diagram from presentation OR code snippets overlay

SCRIPT:
"Let me quickly highlight our technical stack:

- .NET 10 MAUI Blazor Hybrid for cross-platform native apps
- ML.NET 3.0 for on-device machine learning — no cloud required
- SQLite with Entity Framework Core for local data persistence
- Four-layer architecture: Presentation, Services, AI/ML, and Data

Everything runs locally on the device. Patient data never leaves the 
phone — addressing privacy concerns that are critical in healthcare.

The entire app is a single codebase that compiles to Android, iOS, 
Windows, and macOS."

[TRANSITION: Return to camera or title card]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 9: CONCLUSION & FUTURE VISION (4:30 - 5:00) [30 seconds]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL: Speaker on camera OR closing slide with contact info

SCRIPT:
"To summarize, CareSync brings AI-powered consistency to hospital triage, 
with built-in fairness monitoring, explainable predictions, and complete 
offline functionality.

For the future, we envision adding NLP for natural language symptom input, 
integration with hospital EHR systems via HL7 FHIR, and even image-based 
diagnosis.

We're Team KludgeKings, and this is CareSync — because every patient 
deserves fair, fast, and intelligent care.

Thank you for watching!"
